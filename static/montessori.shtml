                    <p>Maria Montessori was a visionary who disabused the traditional methods of education for being too constrictive and non child friendly. In her lifelong work with children first as a pediatric doctor and then as researcher and educator Maria Montessori stumbled up on the secret to not just retaining children’s attention but to successfully divert it for productive work.</p>
                    <p>Maria Montessori believed that education is an aid for life. Her education philosophy can be summed up in her own words- Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed. She believed the happiness you see in a child is directly proportional to the education he received. She spread her schooling philosophy far and wide to ensure that the first six years of every child lay the best possible foundations for an enriching future.</p>

                        <p>The Montessori philosophy believes that every child is born with a creative mind and a drive to learn. These qualities can be best developed in a free environment. A constructive and proactive methodology, Montessori gives your child the freedom to develop varied interests and the competence needed to get her ready for life.</p>

                    <div class="wrap box-cont pink">
                        <h4>Education Through Senses</h4>
                        <p>Whenever a young child picks up an object, he would bang it on the floor, try to taste it or bend it. This is his way of understanding the textures, girth and use of the object in hand. Montessori promotes this natural inquisitiveness and self learning capabilities of a child. When he uses his hands, and senses he can better understand various concepts like physical properties and usage.</p>

                    <div class="wrap box-cont green">
                        <h4>Individual Rhythm</h4>
                        <p>All children have their own individual pace to work and binding them in a time table may not allow them the time to grasp a concept. In Montessori, the children are not bound by time to learn and hence work at it until they have mastered the concept.</p>

                        <h4>Mixed Age Groups</h4>
                        <p>An integral part of Montessori education is based on learning in a community environment. By exposing children between three and to six years of age to the same environment, older children learn to be more responsible while younger children will have role models to emulate. This will help them learn to work together, co-operate and co-exist like they have to when they go out into the world.</p>

                        <h4>Freedom</h4>
                        <p>Montessori learning gives a child the freedom to choose any activity he wishes to pursue in a day. He can pick and choose the work of the day, repeat an activity any number of times, move around the environment to communicate and interact with other children to observe any activity he may find interesting. The freedom is provided along with guidelines which allow the children to develop discipline and respect toward</p>
